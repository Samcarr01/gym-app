The Complete Fitness Operating System (CFOS)
Ultimate Unified Playbook for Strength, Hypertrophy, Fat Loss,
Performance and Health
Version: 2026-01-12
Built from source materials: - The Complete Fitness Operating System (uploaded PDF) - The Complete
Fitness Operating System - Upgrade Research Report (provided in chat) - In-Depth Research Integration
Report: Filling the 20 Gaps in CFOS (provided in chat) - Prior relevant context in this chat (for example
recovery modalities such as heat and cold exposure)
Executive Summary
This document is a single, unified "fitness operating system" that turns evidence and best practice into
decision rules.
The CFOS in one paragraph
You get results by matching training dose (volume, intensity, frequency) to your level, goal and
recovery capacity, then running a feedback loop (measure, adjust, repeat). Beginners thrive on simple
progression and modest volume. Intermediates need smarter programming (periodisation, volume
cycling, autoregulation). Advanced lifters need high-quality volume, fatigue management, and longer-
term structure.
Non-negotiables
Progressive overload over time (more reps, more load, more sets, better technique, or better
density).
Adequate recovery (sleep, nutrition, stress management). Training stress plus life stress must fit
your recovery budget.
Consistency beats optimisation. A "good plan done for 12 weeks" beats a "perfect plan done for
2 weeks".
Training dose: unified ranges by level
These ranges deliberately overlap because individuals vary. You will calibrate using readiness,
performance, soreness and sustainability.

Why overlaps exist: the PDF gives practical set ranges (Beg 8-12, Int 12-16, Adv up to 20-24). The
research reports add a broader envelope (for example Int 12-18, Adv 16-24) and introduce MEV-MAV-
MRV landmarks. CFOS treats these as compatible: use the overlap as your starting point, then adjust.
The 5 control loops
Training plateau loop: diagnose technique, recovery, dose, then deload or adjust variables.
Fat loss loop: every 2 weeks, adjust calories or activity based on trend rate.
Bulk loop: target slow gain (usually 0.25-0.5% bodyweight per week) and adjust if off target.
Readiness loop: daily readiness score modulates volume and intensity.
Injury loop: pain and function drive regressions and return-to-training progression.
Default recommendations that work for most people
Train each muscle 2x per week.
Use compound lifts as the base, add isolation to fill gaps.
Keep most sets hard but not maximal (around 1-3 RIR).
Insert a deload when fatigue accumulates or every ~4-6 weeks if training hard and progressing.
Track only what you will actually use to adjust decisions (logbook, bodyweight trend, waist,
sleep).

4. Goal Modules
4.1 Strength
Training prescription (from the PDF, unified)
Base lifts: squats, presses, deadlifts, rows, pull-ups.
Sets and reps: often 3-6 sets of 1-5 reps.
Rest: 2-3 minutes for heavy work.
Intensity: typically 70-90% of 1RM, heavier for peaking.
Progression by level
Beginner: linear progression (add small load or reps each session).
Intermediate: undulating periodisation (rotate rep ranges) or linear waves.
Advanced: block periodisation (hypertrophy block then strength block then peak).
Strength accessory rules
Accessories exist to address weak links and add hypertrophy with lower systemic cost.
Keep accessories in higher rep ranges (6-15), push close to failure, manage joint stress.
4.2 Hypertrophy
Dose targets
Evidence summaries and the PDF agree that weekly sets are a major driver of hypertrophy. Practical
targets: - Beginners: often ~8-12 sets per muscle per week. - Intermediates: often ~12-16 (some
sources 12-18). - Advanced: often ~16-24, calibrated by recoverability.
Proximity to failure
Most sets: 1-3 RIR.
Failure sets: optional, used sparingly, usually on isolation or last sets.
Exercise selection and variation
Rules for variation (from the research upgrade): - Keep key exercises stable for a cycle (6-12 weeks) to
allow progressive overload. - Rotate 1 variable at a time when progress stalls (exercise, rep range,
volume distribution). - Use variation to cover regions of a muscle, but avoid random "muscle confusion".
Frequency and splits
Train each muscle at least 2x per week for most lifters.
Higher frequency is mainly a tool to distribute volume and improve set quality.

Behaviour, Habits and Adherence
Metrics and Feedback Loops
Myth-Busting FAQ
Templates, Checklists and Example Plans
References and Appendix
1. How to Use CFOS
Step 1: Define your inputs
Goal: strength, hypertrophy, fat loss, recomposition, performance, general health.
Training level: beginner, intermediate, advanced.
Constraints: days per week, equipment, injuries, job stress, sleep, travel.
Step 2: Select your programme skeleton
Pick a split that fits your schedule first. Then make it effective. - 2-3 days: full-body - 4 days: upper/lower
- 5-6 days: push/pull/legs or specialised splits
Step 3: Set dose targets and progression rules
Choose weekly sets and distribute them across your training days.
Choose rep ranges aligned to the goal.
Choose a progression model appropriate to your level.
Step 4: Run the feedback loop
Every week you review: training performance, bodyweight trend, waist or measurements, recovery and
adherence. Then you adjust one variable at a time.
2. Foundations of Adaptation and Training Variables
2.1 Principles
Overload: the body adapts to repeated stress. Increase the stimulus gradually.
Specificity: you adapt to what you train. Train the quality you want.
Individualisation: the right dose depends on your history, recovery and constraints.
2.2 The stimulus-recovery-adaptation cycle
Training is only effective if recovery is sufficient. - Stimulus without recovery equals stagnation. -
Recovery without stimulus equals maintenance or decline.
2.3 Training variables
From the uploaded PDF, CFOS treats the training stimulus as the interaction of: - Volume: hard working
sets (and the reps within them) per muscle per week. - Intensity: load relative to 1RM or effort rating. -
Frequency: how often a muscle is trained each week.

4.6 Power and Athleticism
Power prescription (from the PDF)
Olympic lift derivatives and plyometrics.
Low reps (1-3), longer rest (2-4 minutes).
Prioritise quality and speed.
When to include
Athletes.
Anyone who wants "pop", coordination, and athletic carryover.
5. Programming Architecture
5.1 Selecting your split
Days per week Best default Why
2 Full-body Minimum effective approach, high consistency
3 Full-body High frequency per muscle, simple recovery
4 Upper/lower Easy 2x frequency, strong balance
5-6 PPL or specialised Best for higher volume distribution
5.2 Volume landmarks: MEV-MAV-MRV
(From the research integration report) - MEV: minimum effective volume. - MAV: maximum adaptive
volume. - MRV: maximum recoverable volume.
Practical interpretation: - Start near MEV if you are busy, stressed, older, injured, or inconsistent. - Move
toward MAV when stable and progressing. - Approach MRV only in short, planned blocks with excellent
recovery.
5.3 Progression models
Linear progression
Best for beginners. - Add load or reps each session. - When stalls occur, reduce load slightly and build
back up.
Daily undulating periodisation (DUP)
Best for intermediates. - Example week for a lift: heavy (3-5 reps), medium (6-8), light (10-12).
Block periodisation
Best for advanced and some athletes. - 4-6 weeks hypertrophy emphasis. - 3-4 weeks strength
emphasis. - 1-2 weeks peaking or testing.

Altitude - Expect reduced performance early. - Reduce intensity and volume initially.
7.5 Minimum recovery standards
At least 1-2 rest days per week for most people.
Prioritise sleep quantity and quality.
Meet protein targets.
8. Injury Prevention and Return-to-Training
8.1 Injury prevention rules
Progress gradually. Avoid sudden spikes in load.
Use dynamic warm-ups.
Prioritise technique.
Balance push and pull and include joint stabilisers.
8.2 Pain decision tree
Muscle burn and soreness are normal.
Sharp, stabbing, joint pain, instability, numbness, or pain that alters movement is not.
Stop and modify if pain is concerning.
8.3 Red flags
Seek medical evaluation if there is: - Sudden severe pain. - Joint locking or giving way. - Numbness or
tingling. - Rapid swelling. - Inability to bear weight.
8.4 Return-to-training phases
Restore pain-free range of motion.
Rebuild baseline strength with light loads.
Progressively reload toward previous loads.
Return to normal training while keeping preventative work.
9. Special Populations and Individual Differences
9.1 Women
Principles are the same, but cycle symptoms can affect readiness.
Auto-regulate based on energy and symptoms.
Watch for low energy availability and RED-S signs.
9.2 Older trainees
From the PDF: resistance training is key against sarcopenia. - Start lower volume, add recovery. - Include
balance and power safely.

4.3 Fat Loss and Strength Retention
Primary rule
Fat loss requires a calorie deficit. Training preserves strength and muscle.
Rate targets
Typical target: 0.5-1.0% bodyweight loss per week.
Leaner or highly trained people often do better with the slower end.
Training during a deficit
Keep heavy strength work in the programme.
Reduce volume first if recovery is compromised.
Add cardio carefully so it does not erase recovery capacity.
4.4 Body Recomposition
When recomp works best
Beginners.
Detrained returners.
Higher body fat individuals.
Recomp rules
Calories: maintenance or small deficit.
Protein: high end of the target range.
Training: progressive overload, usually 2-3x per muscle per week.
Tracking: use waist and performance metrics, not only scale weight.
4.5 Conditioning: Zone 2 and Intervals
Zone 2 (from the PDF)
Roughly 60-75% of threshold effort.
"Can hold a conversation" pace.
Improves aerobic base, mitochondrial density and recovery capacity.
Intervals
High-intensity intervals improve peak fitness efficiently but cost more recovery.
Interference management
If strength or hypertrophy is priority, keep cardio volume modest.
Separate hard cardio and hard lifting by several hours where possible.
In a deficit, prefer more Zone 2 and steps before adding excessive HIIT.

The Complete Fitness Operating System
Foundations of Fitness
Adaptation & Overload - The human body adapts to stress; to gain strength, size or endurance you must
progressively increase training stimulus. This can be done by adding weight, reps, sets, reducing rest or
increasing frequency. A 2022 review noted that hypertrophy occurs over a wide range of loads (5-30 reps),
provided sets are hard and progression is applied . Adequate recovery (sleep, nutrition, rest days) is
essential because adaptation happens between sessions, not during them. Training should follow the
stimulus-recovery-adaptation cycle: apply stress, recover, then adapt.
In practice the body follows a General Adaptation Syndrome: an initial alarm phase when a new stressor
causes fatigue and soreness, a resistance phase where the body adapts and performance rebounds above
baseline, and an exhaustion phase if overload is excessive or recovery is insufficient. To stay in the
productive resistance phase, increase total load gradually-no more than about 10 % per week-and
respect rest periods. Overly aggressive jumps in weight or volume push the body into exhaustion,
increasing injury risk and stalling progress.
Specificity & Individualisation - Adaptations are specific to the muscles and energy systems trained (e.g.,
heavy squats build lower body strength; long runs improve aerobic efficiency). Programmes should respect
individual goals, experience, and recovery capacity. Beginners need less volume and recover quicker;
advanced trainees may require more specialised programming and longer recovery.
This concept is encapsulated in the SAID (Specific Adaptations to Imposed Demands) principle. The body
improves in direct response to the type of stress placed upon it-heavy squats make you stronger at squats,
long runs build endurance, but neither makes you a better sprinter unless you train sprinting. The corollary
is "use it or lose it": adaptations wane when the specific stimulus is removed. Training programmes must
therefore align with the athlete's precise goal and include movement patterns that counteract the stresses
of daily life (e.g., hip opening exercises for desk workers).
Progression vs Maintenance - For novices, almost any structured programme will build strength and
endurance. As you become stronger, progress slows and deliberate load increases, varied rep ranges and
strategic deloads become important. Maintenance requires less volume - once you hit a strength or
conditioning milestone, a reduced training load can sustain it while freeing capacity for other goals.

avoid the classic error of prescribing intermediate programming to a true beginner or vice versa. The key
determinant is how quickly you can make progress:
Trainee continuum
Level Characteristics Programme focus Progression rate
Beginner
Linear gains are still
possible; strength and
skill improve every
session or week. This
includes people
returning after a long
layoff.
Emphasise mastery of fundamental
movement patterns (squat, hinge,
push, pull). Use simple full body or
upper/lower programmes 2-4 days/
week. Keep weekly volume around
8-12 sets per muscle group.
Add weight or
reps every
workout until
progress stalls.
Intermediate
Linear progression has
slowed; gains occur
month to month. More
stimulus is needed to
elicit adaptation.
Introduce split routines (push/pull/
legs, upper/lower) across 4-5 days/
week. Increase weekly volume to
~12-16 sets per muscle group and
use more structured periodisation
(e.g. linear or undulating). Track
fatigue and employ deloads.
Progress weight
or volume each
mesocycle (3-
6 weeks) rather
than each
session.
Advanced
Nearing genetic
potential; strength or
hypertrophy gains take
months. Recovery
capacity is limited and
must be perfectly
managed.
Highly individualised programming
with periodised blocks focusing on
one primary goal (strength,
hypertrophy, power or
conditioning). Volume may rise to
18-22+ sets per muscle group, but
only if recovery (sleep, stress,
nutrition) is impeccable. Use
auto regulation and exercise
variation to address weak points.
Progress occurs
over 2-6 month
cycles; focus on
quality over
quantity.
Athlete vs general population
Athletes and general fitness enthusiasts share the same basic movements but differ in their ultimate aims
and stress management. The table below outlines these differences to guide programme selection and
recovery strategies:
Aspect Athlete General population
Primary goal
Maximise sport specific performance
(power, speed, endurance) and
competition results.
Improve overall health, body
composition and functional fitness for
life.

Cross Training & Transfer
Complement sport training with auxiliary activities: swimmers may benefit from resistance training, runners
from Pilates for core stability, and fighters from yoga for flexibility. Cross training prevents overuse injuries
and develops complementary attributes.
Workout Programming
Splits
Full Body - Train all major muscle groups each session (3 /week). Ideal for beginners, busy
professionals or those focusing on strength/maintenance.
Upper/Lower - Alternate upper and lower body sessions (4 /week). Allows higher frequency per
muscle group while managing fatigue.
Push/Pull/Legs (PPL) - Divide sessions into pushing (chest, shoulders, triceps), pulling (back, biceps)
and legs. Typical schedule: P P L rest P P L or P L P L P rest. Higher weekly frequency (each muscle
2 /week) promotes hypertrophy.
Bro Split - Each muscle group once per week (e.g., chest day, back day). Suitable for bodybuilders
with high volume per session but less effective for natural lifters because muscle protein synthesis
peaks within ~48 h.
Sample PPL Week (6 days)
Day 1 - Push: Bench press 3 6, incline dumbbell press 3 8-10, overhead press 3 6-8, triceps dips
3 10-12.
Day 2 - Pull: Deadlift 3 5, pull ups 3 max, bent over row 3 8-10, face pulls 3 12-15, biceps curls
3 10-12.
Day 3 - Legs: Back squat 4 6, Romanian deadlift 3 8, walking lunges 3 12 per leg, calf raises 3 15-
20.
Day 4 - Rest or active recovery (yoga/walking).
Day 5 - Push (variations): Decline press, dumbbell shoulder press, lateral raises, triceps pushdowns.
Day 6 - Pull (variations): Barbell row, pull downs, rear delt raises, hammer curls.
Day 7 - Legs (variations): Front squat, leg press, split squats, leg curls.
Adjust volume, intensity and exercise selection based on experience. Beginners should start with 2-3 sets
per exercise; advanced lifters may use more.
Periodisation & Progression
Periodisation manipulates volume and intensity to optimise long term progress. Common models:
Linear - Gradually increase intensity while decreasing volume over weeks (e.g., 12 weeks: high reps
 moderate reps low reps). Good for novices.
Undulating (nonlinear) - Vary intensity and volume within a week (e.g., heavy, moderate, light
days). Daily or weekly undulating models allow continued progress by avoiding plateaus .
Block - Focus each block (2-8 weeks) on a specific quality (e.g., hypertrophy block, strength block,
power block) .

Safety is paramount. When in doubt, consult a medical professional, physiotherapist or sports medicine
doctor to diagnose the problem and design an appropriate rehabilitation plan.
Long Term Adaptability
Fitness is a lifelong journey; goals and capacities evolve.
Decade Scale Planning
Periodise your training across years and decades. For example, focus on building a strength foundation in
your 20s-30s, maintain muscle and develop endurance in your 40s-50s, prioritise mobility and balance in
your 60s and beyond. Each phase builds the base for the next.
Goal Pivoting & Life Transitions
Major life events (parenthood, career changes, illness) require flexibility. When time is scarce, shift to
maintenance programmes (e.g., two 30 minute full body sessions per week). After injury or pregnancy,
emphasise rehabilitation and gradual progression.
Burnout Prevention & Autoregulation
Rotate training modalities (strength, cardio, sports) to keep workouts fresh. Use autoregulation-adjust
loads based on readiness, mood and sleep-to avoid pushing through fatigue. Periodically reassess goals;
progress is not linear.
Lifelong Learning & Adaptation
Stay curious: learn new sports, attend workshops, explore different training philosophies. Adaptation to
novelty keeps the nervous system resilient and prevents stagnation. Embrace variation while maintaining
core principles of progressive overload and recovery.
Measurement & Feedback Loops
Tracking Progress - Keep a training log recording exercises, loads, sets, reps, perceived exertion (RPE) and
notes. Monitor body weight, circumference measurements and body fat (using scales or calipers).
Wearables & Apps - Devices like heart rate monitors, smartwatches or rings can track heart rate variability,
sleep quality and daily movement. For example, the UT Austin study used wearable data to show that daily
exercise improves deep sleep .
Performance Metrics - Test your 1 rep maxes, submaximal lifts, vertical jump, mile time or VO max
periodically (every 8-12 weeks). Adjust training based on trends: if strength stalls, try deloading or altering
volume; if body fat loss stops, adjust calorie intake.
